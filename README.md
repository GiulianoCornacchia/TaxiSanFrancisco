<i>Each San Francisco based Yellow Cab vehicle is currently outfitted with a GPS tracking device that is used by dispatchers to efficiently reach customers. The data is transmitted from each cab to a central receiving station and then delivered in real-time to dispatch computers via a central server. This system broadcasts the cab call number, location, and whether the cab currently has a fare.</i>

This project aims to analyze the GPS traces of 536 taxis operating in San Francisco over 25 days.

The methods and tools used in this project are the ones presented in the Ph.D. course "Data Mining & Machine Learning Fundamentals" held by Mirco Nanni, a Researcher at ISTI - CNR in Pisa.

The dataset containing the mobility trajectories can be freely downloaded at https://crawdad.org/epfl/mobility/20090224/.
