This project aims to analyze the GPS traces of 536 taxis operating in San Francisco over 25 days.
<br><br>
<i>Each San Francisco based Yellow Cab vehicle is currently outfitted with a GPS tracking device that is used by dispatchers to efficiently reach customers. The data is transmitted from each cab to a central receiving station and then delivered in real-time to dispatch computers via a central server. This system broadcasts the cab call number, location, and whether the cab currently has a fare.</i>
